Configuration
=============

Setting up the app
------------------

Add ``iprestrict``, and ``templatetag_handlebars`` to
``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your settings file::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'templatetag_handlebars',
    'iprestrict',
  )

Run the migrations for the ``iprestrict`` application::

  $ ./manage.py migrate iprestrict

Enable Django Admin for at least the iprestrict application.

Make sure that the egg template loader is enabled in your setting file::

  TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
    ...
    'django.template.loaders.eggs.Loader',
  )

Add the urls of iprestrict to your project. Ex in your root urls.py::

  from django.conf.urls import url, include

  urlpatterns = [
      # ... snip ...
      url(r'^iprestrict/', include('iprestrict.urls')),

This configuration should be enough to let you configure and test your restriction rules.

Configuring the restriction rules
---------------------------------

Go to your admin page and open IPRestrict Rules to get a list of your current rules.

The rules consist of:

* an URL pattern - this is regex that will be matched against the URL requested by the client. The value "ALL" is special and it will always match (a tad nicer than .*)
* an IP Group - a named group of IP addresses. Examples would be "localnet", "Trusted net", "Sam's Home IP"etc. or the provided "ALL" and "localhost"
* an Action (labeled "Is allowed?") - what to do if both the client url and the ip match the URL Pattern and the IP Group. Possible values are "ALLOW" and "DENY" to allow or deny the request.

The rules are checked in the order you see them from top to bottom. The url the client requested is matched against the URL Pattern and the client IP address is checked if it is in the IP Group. In the case both conditions are true the processing of rules stop, and the fate of the request is decided based on the Action.

If no rules match the request the request will just fall through (ie it will be allowed).

As you can see after installation 2 rules are provided by default.

* The first one allows all request from localhost
* The second denies all requests

This is a deny by default strategy, when you will have to create rules for all the IP addresses that can access the application explicitly.

To allow everything by default and specify the IP addresses you would like to deny access simply delete the ALL, ALL, DENY rule.

The order of the rules can be changed by clicking the "Move Up" and "Move Down" links.

Example config::

  /admin/.* localnet ALLOW
  /admin/.* ALL DENY

These rules would restrict access to admin only from localnet, but allow access to the rest of the application.

Example config 2::

  ALL "Fishy IPs" DENY
  ALL "Trusted Nets" ALLOW
  ALL ALL DENY

App can be used only from "Trusted Nets", but even inside the Trusted Nets there are some IPs you would like to Deny access to (defined in "Fishy IPs").

Sooner or later you will probably have to define some IP Groups (ex. like Trusted Nets above).

IP Groups have a name and an optional longer description and they are defined by a a list of IP Ranges.
IP Ranges can be:

* a single IP address (complete just the First ip field)
* a subnet (complete the First ip field and the CIDR prefix length)
* a range of ip addressess (complete the First ip and the Last ip in the range and leave the Cidfr prefix length empty)

Ex.

+-------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+--------------+
| Value                               | First ip    | Cidr prefix length | Last ip      |
+=====================================+=============+====================+==============+
| single ip 192.168.1.1               | 192.168.1.1 |                    |              |
+-------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+--------------+
| subnet 192.168.1.1/24               + 192.168.1.1 | 24                 |              |
+-------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+--------------+
| ip range 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.10 | 192.168.1.1 |                    | 192.168.1.10 |
+-------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+--------------+

Testing the rules
-----------------

When you are happy with the rules you set up, you might want to test them.

Go to YOUR_URL/iprestrict/ page. You can use the page to enter any URL and IP Address and Test them against the rules in your database.


Enabling the middleware
-----------------------

Add ``iprestrict.middleware.IPRestrictMiddleware`` to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` in your settings file. Generally, you will want this middleware to run early, before your session, auth etc. middlewares::

  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
      'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
      'iprestrict.middleware.IPRestrictMiddleware',
      ...
  )

Your Django project is now restricted based on the rules defined.


Settings
--------

Django IP Restrict has settings to adapt to the environment in which
your app is hosted in.

IPRESTRICT_RELOAD_RULES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``True``

When set to ``False`` rules will be reloaded only after restarting the
server. See :ref:`rules-are-cached`.


IPRESTRICT_IGNORE_PROXY_HEADER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``False``

When this setting is ``True``, Django IP Restrict will completely
disregard the ``X-Forwarded-For`` HTTP header. Normally, the
middleware would block requests with a suspect value for
``X-Forwarded-For``.


IPRESTRICT_TRUSTED_PROXIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``[]`` (Empty List)

Use this setting when your app is hosted behind a reverse proxy. When
values are provided, they will be checked against the HTTP
``X-Forwarded-For`` header to determine the true client IP address.
